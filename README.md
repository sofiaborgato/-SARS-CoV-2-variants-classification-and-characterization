# SARS-CoV-2 variants classification and characterization
Preprocessing and description of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and classification into variants according to their key mutations with respect to the reference genome sequence Wuhan-Hu-1.
Final project for the course "Bioinformatics", A.Y. 2020/2021.

## Data
We used genome sequences from ['GISAID Dataset'](https://www.gisaid.org/). The dataset contains sequences 29kb long from the genome of the virus with <1% of unknown bases, divided according to the lineage considered and the date and place of submission. We download 6500 sequences:
* 1000 samples from the original cases from Wuhan in January 2020
* 1000 samples from lineage B.1.1.7 (English variant)}
* 1000 samples from lineage B.1.351 (South-African variant)
* 1000 samples from lineage P.1 (Brazilian variant)
* 1000 samples from lineage B.1.427/B.1.429 (Californian variant)
* 1000 samples from lineage B.1.525 (Nigerian variant)
* 500 samples from lineage B.1.617 (Indian variant)
